# DICOM Viewer Web App

This project is a simple web application that allows users to upload and view DICOM medical images directly in the browser. Built with React and the Cornerstone.js suite, it displays both the image and important metadata from the uploaded DICOM file. This tool is ideal for demonstrating basic medical imaging workflows and DICOM file handling in a modern web environment.
